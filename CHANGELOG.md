## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet. First public push lives below.

## [0.1.0-beta.1] - first public pre-release

End-to-end tested locally against the in-tree RTMP sink with `ffmpeg`
publishing a synthetic H.264 + AAC source: ingest, codec classification,
forwarding to destination, and the full `arm → activate → cut → disarm`
state machine all behave correctly.

**Not yet tested against real Twitch / YouTube / Kick ingests.** That's the
gap between `-beta.1` and the eventual `v0.1.0`. If you're a streamer
willing to try it on a low-stakes session and report back, the bug
template is in [Issues](https://github.com/Soulhackzlol/InstantClone/issues).

See `0.1.0` below for the full feature list.

## [0.1.0] - first public release

### Added

- Two-phase delay state machine: arm → preparing → ready → active → cut.
  Activation is instant on screen; cuts are IDR-aligned with monotonic
  timestamp rewriting so destination players don't glitch.
- Multi-destination egress. One OBS feed fans out to Twitch + YouTube +
  Kick + custom RTMP endpoints, each with its own enable toggle and per-
  destination bitrate / reconnects / cut counters.
- Disk-backed ring buffer (`./instantclone.buf`, default 300 MB ≈ 7 min
  at 6 Mbps). In-memory IDR index with O(log n) seek. Reset on every
  clean shutdown.
- Hand-rolled HTTP/1.1 web UI: full dashboard at `/`, compact OBS dock at
  `/dock`, themable browser-source overlays at `/overlay?style=…` (9 styles,
  5 languages: en, es, pt, fr, de).
- Server-Sent Events stream at `/events` for live state push (replaces
  polling). Polling fallback for clients that don't support SSE.
- Pre-gzipped HTML payload at build time (~115 KB source → ~25 KB gzipped).
  Build pipeline minifies + gzips via `flate2` as a build-only dep.
- HTTP API for Stream Deck / scripts: `POST /arm`, `/activate`, `/disarm`,
  `/stop`, `/delay`. CSRF guard on POSTs via Origin/Host comparison.
- Tray icon (Windows) with status header, conditional **Cut delay**,
  **Open dashboard / dock**, **Copy RTMP URL**, **Quit**. Hand-rolled `.ico`
  generated at build time. Runs with no console window
  (`#![windows_subsystem = "windows"]`).
- Port-conflict pre-flight: detects the owning PID + executable name via
  `GetExtendedTcpTable` + `QueryFullProcessImageNameW`, pops a native
  modal asking the user to switch to the next free port or quit, persists
  the choice.
- 86 unit tests covering the state machine, AMF0 codec + recursion guard,
  H.264 + Enhanced RTMP IDR detection, ring-buffer eviction with in-flight-
  read protection, port-conflict FFI roundtrip, HTTP parsing, CSRF policy,
  config form parsing + save/load round-trip, and `accepts_gzip` content
  negotiation.

### Notes

- Windows-only at this version. The code is mostly portable but the tray,
  port pre-flight, and process / RSS sampler have Windows-specific paths.
- No automated release pipeline yet. Build from source per the README.
